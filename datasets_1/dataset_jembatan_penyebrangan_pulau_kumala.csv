yopie franz,"This was the last destination we visited from a series of other tourist attractions in Tenggarong.

I thought it would be normal. It turns out that if you go out with friends it will be more fun here. Apart from of course if you bring your family.

Feel the sensation of walking on a bridge which sometimes sways slightly due to the wind.

You can take photos or record videos while on the bridge. Or take a photo of this bridge before crossing and from the direction of Kumala Island.

There is a paid entry ticket to the bridge. Cheap, only Rp. 7000/person.

Oh yes, there are lots of padlocks on this bridge. It seems like there is some sort of custom for young couples to put a padlock with their names on it here.

Nice bridge to see.

Yes, just adjust it to your budget.
It's just that the island is not well maintained in terms of cleanliness because it was closed some time ago. If you come here, make sure you bring food or drink because there's nothing to sell inside, so make sure before crossing the pedestrian bridge, look for supplies first 😁😁😁

The motorbike and car parking area is spacious, the parking attendant is friendly. There are lots of food and drink vendors, so you don't need to be afraid of being hungry. When the sun is hot, there is also an umbrella rental service. To get to Kumala Island itself, we have to walk across the iconic Repo Repo Bridge.

Actually, this island is very beautiful, and has a lot of potential, but unfortunately the maintenance is not optimal. If it is not looked after and left to be damaged, it would be a shame.
