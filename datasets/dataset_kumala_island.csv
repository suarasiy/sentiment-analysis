Jol Shawabi,"Previously, when I went there in 2007, Kumala Island in Timbau, Tenggarong was really exciting. The rides there function well, and the historical heritage is well maintained.

But unfortunately, when I returned in 2021, the condition had changed drastically. Many of the rides are broken and no one seems to be taking care of them. It seems like the government or the budget doesn't really care.

In fact, Kumala Island could be an important source of income for the region. Come on, let's speak out and encourage Kumala Island to rise again! Everyone can join in, and we can make this place like it was before. :) 💪🏝️ #SaveKumalaPulau",Local Guide · 29 reviews · 13 photos,a year ago,[no_minires_images],4 stars,4

Jamaludin,"The Kumala Island tourist attraction, which is located in the middle of the Mahakam River, is a recreation park that combines modern technology and traditional culture. This 76 hectare island was once a wasteland and bushes. Currently, some areas are equipped with various facilities such as a 100 meter high sky tower to enjoy the beauty from the air, a mini railway play area and a cable car that connects to the mainland.

On this island there is a DSJ Resort complete with a swimming pool and facilities for those who want to rest, namely the only cottage in the middle of the Mahakam River. At this island location there is a giant aquarium for porpoises, freshwater dolphins which only exist in the People's Republic of China. and Brazil.

The construction of the Kumala Island Tourist Park is being carried out in stages and will continue to develop. In this way, the public will get additional representative tourist attractions besides the Mulawarman Museum (former palace of the Kutai Kartanegara Kingdom), Panji Sukarame Reservoir, Pondok Labu Cultural Village in Tenggarong and Nusa Tuna in Muara Muntai District which has white sand.

Kumala Island Tourist Park is around 27 km from Samarinda City which can be reached via the Kutai Kartanegara Bridge in approximately 30 minutes. Meanwhile, from Balikpapan City, which has Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport facilities and Semayang Harbor, which is access to air and sea transportation in East Kalimantan, the distance is around 130 km which can be reached in approximately 3 hours by road. Apart from that, Kumala Island Tourist Park can also be reached by water transportation via the Mahakam River.",Local Guide · 69 reviews · 58 photos,4 years ago,[no_minires_images],5 stars,5
